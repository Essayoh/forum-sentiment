# Forum Sentiment
How do the forums feel?

Born during the Automattic Hack Day 2015 and iterated since, this little guy takes in the URL of a forum thread at https://en.forums.wordpress.com 
and runs it through a sentiment analysis, spitting out the total positive words, total negative words, and total overall word count.

My hope over time is to iterate a bit more to make those numbers meaningful (maybe even change the positive/negative corpuses (corpusii?) to better reflect this use case) - I'd love to create a "Sentimentomattic" that spits out a general score, measurable and comparable over time.
